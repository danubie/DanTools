Collection of little Helpers
What was my inspiration
It's been now 15 years ago since I requested to be acknowledged as a maintainer of an orphaned project on Sourceforge.
Meanwhile my job and my focus has changed very much.
As a teamleader for operating web and sql installations, I do have to care about other things.
One of these is to take a look for reduce my effort on routine work.
This is the reason why some of the functions came into my mind.
I want to share it with others - so this is my first collection
Get-IsaAdminCredential - get-credential or different Domains according to our rules
Test-IsaDatabaseCredential - helps me to validate SQL-DB access to DBs
